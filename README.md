- 👋 Hi, I’m @MI77
- 👀 I’m interested in data (specifically I work on [Microsoft Fabric](https://fabric.microsoft.com), indie game development, music, Lego, and other non-tech stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning indie game development! I'm working on an isometric puzzle game called [Envrionmini](https://mi77.itch.io/environmini).
- 💞️ I’m looking for any feedback on input on my game! You can try it on [itch.io](https://mi77.itch.io/environmini), and re-use or suggest changes to it [here](https://github.com/MI77/Environmini).
- 📫 How to reach me - here on Github, or on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/mi77.bsky.social)
